## Project Overview
"RSVP Movies Data Analysis" is a comprehensive data analysis project aiming to leverage insights from movie data spanning three years (2017 - 2019). 
As a prominent Indian film production company, RSVP Movies has earned acclaim for its consistent delivery of super-hit movies that resonate with diverse audiences.
This data analysis initiative is driven by a commitment to infuse creativity with data-driven decision-making. With a rich history of crafting successful films, RSVP Movies seeks to further enhance its global footprint by tailoring a cinematic experience for audiences worldwide in 2024. To ensure the success of this ambitious venture, RSVP Movies has embraced the power of data analytics.

As a data analyst and SQL expert, my role in this project is to meticulously analyze and interpret the vast repository of movie-related data. The goal is not only to understand past trends but to uncover actionable insights that will guide RSVP Movies in making strategic decisions aligned with the preferences and expectations of a diverse global audience.

We will address this case using the following methodology:

`ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYSE, SHARE AND ACT`


## **ASK**
This phase involves defining the issue to be solved, identifying stakeholders and what their expectations from the project are.

## PROCESS
This phase of the analysis process includes cleaning the data and making sure it is fit for purpose. As well as making any modifications necessary.

<br>

A summary of the cleaning and manipulation done to the data is presented below:

1.	Removing 4,466 Null values from the Movie Table will reduce the number of Observations from 7997  to 3531 hence I will ignore the null values.
2.	Added quarter, month, day_of_week and time_period columns to the Movie Table.
3.	Converted the month column by assigning (1 - January and 12 - December)
4.	Converted the day_of_week column by assigning (1 - Sunday and 7 - Saturday).
5.	Converted the duration column by assigning (Short - less than 90min, Standard - From 90min to 120min, and Long - Greater than 120min)
6.	Created separate tables for director and character information by combining columns using INNER JOIN.

<br>

The Data Cleaning Process:

1. Checking all Null values in the Movie Table

```sql

-- Identifying columns with Null values in the Movie table--
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS id_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN title IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS title_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN year IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS year_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN date_published IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS date_published_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN duration IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS duration_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN country IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS country_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN worldwide_gross_income IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS worlwide_gross_income_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN languages IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS languages_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN production_company IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS production_company_null_count
FROM movie;

```

</div>


2. Adding quarter, month and day_of_week columns to the Movie Table.

```sql

-- Adding Quarter, Month and Day of week columns to the Movie Table --
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movie_added;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movie_added AS -- Table with quarter, month, and day_of_week columns
SELECT
    id,
    title,
    year,
    QUARTER(date_published) AS quarter_num,
    MONTH(date_published) AS month_num,
	DAYOFWEEK(date_published) AS day_of_week_num,
    date_published,
    duration,
    country,
    worldwide_gross_income,
    languages,
    production_company
FROM movie;


```

</div>

<br>

3. Converting month, day_of_week, time_period,  and duration columns alongside adding time_period column to the Movie Table.

```sql

-- Converting month, day_of_week, time_period and duration columns in the Movie Table --
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movie_converted;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movie_converted AS 
  SELECT
    *,
    CASE day_of_week_num
      WHEN 1 THEN 'Sunday'
      WHEN 2 THEN 'Monday'
      WHEN 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
      WHEN 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
      WHEN 5 THEN 'Thursday'
      WHEN 6 THEN 'Friday'
  ELSE 'Saturday'
  END AS day_of_week,
     CASE 
      WHEN day_of_week_num IN (1, 7) THEN 'weekend'
      ELSE 'weekday'
    END AS time_period,
  CASE month_num
      WHEN 1 THEN 'January'
      WHEN 2 THEN 'February'
      WHEN 3 THEN 'March'
      WHEN 4 THEN 'April'
      WHEN 5 THEN 'May'
      WHEN 6 THEN 'June'
      WHEN 7 THEN 'July'
      WHEN 8 THEN 'August'
      WHEN 9 THEN 'September'
      WHEN 10 THEN 'October'
      WHEN 11 THEN 'November'
  ELSE 'December'
  END AS  month ,
  CASE 
    WHEN duration1 < 90 THEN 'Short '
    WHEN duration1 >= 90 AND duration1 <=120 THEN 'Standard'
    ELSE 'Long'
    END AS duration
 FROM movie_added;

```

4. Creating a table for director information by combining columns using INNER JOIN

```sql

-- Creating a table for director information
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movie_director_table AS
SELECT -- Combining all columns using INNER JOIN for final analysis
    MC.*,
    DM.name_id,
    N.name AS director_name,
    N.height,
    N.date_of_birth,
    G.genre,
    R.avg_rating,
    R.total_votes,
    R.median_rating
FROM movie_converted MC
INNER JOIN director_mapping DM ON MC.id = DM.movie_id
INNER JOIN names N ON DM.name_id = N.id
INNER JOIN genre G ON DM.movie_id = G.movie_id
INNER JOIN ratings R ON DM.movie_id = R.movie_id ;

```

</div>

<br>



5. Creating a table for character information by combining columns using INNER JOIN

```sql

-- Creating a table for character information
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movie_character_table AS
SELECT -- Combining all columns using INNER JOIN for final analysis
    MC.*,
    RM.category,
    N.name,    
    N.height,
    N.date_of_birth,
    G.genre,
    R.avg_rating,
    R.total_votes,
    R.median_rating
FROM movie_converted MC
INNER JOIN role_mapping RM ON MC.id = RM.movie_id
INNER JOIN names N ON RM.name_id = N.id
INNER JOIN genre G ON RM.movie_id = G.movie_id
INNER JOIN ratings R ON G.movie_id = R.movie_id;

```
